- **Different file formats**
  - Delimited text file formats, or .CSV
    - used to store data as text
    - each value is seperated by delimier
    - delimiter - a sequence of one or more characters for specifying the boundaries between one or more values.
    - Eg delimiters - Comma(CSV), Tab(TSV), Colon, vertical bar, space
  - Microsoft excel Open .XML spreadsheet or .XLSX
    - Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet, or XLSX, is a Microsoft Excel Open XML file format that falls under the spreadsheet file format.
    - It is an XML-based file format created by Microsoft.
    - In an .XLSX, also known as a workbook, there can be multiple worksheets.
    - And each worksheet is organized into rows and columns, at the intersection of which is the cell.
    - Each cell contains data.
    - XLSX uses the open file format, which means it is generally accessible to most other applications.
    - It can use and save all functions available in Excel and is also known to be one of the more secure file formats as it cannot save malicious code. 
  - Extensible Markup Language, or .XML
    - Extensible Markup Language, or XML, is a markup language with set rules for encoding data.
    - The XML file format is both readable by humans and machines.
    - It is a self-descriptive language designed for sending information over the internet.
    - XML is similar to HTML in some respects, but also has differences.
    - For example, an .XML does not use predefined tags like .HTML does.
    - XML is platform independent and programming language independent and therefore simplifies data sharing between various systems. 
  - Portable Document Format, or .PDF
    - Portable Document Format, or PDF, is a file format developed by Adobe to present documents independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems, which means it can be viewed the same way on any device.
    - This format is frequently used in legal and financial documents and can also be used to fill in data such as for forms.
  - Javascript Object Notation, or .JSON
    - JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, is a text-based open standard designed for transmitting structured data over the web.
    - The file format is a language-independent data format that can be read in any programming language.
    - JSON is easy to use, is compatible with a wide range of browsers, and is considered as one of the best tools for sharing data of any size and type, even audio and video.
    - That is one reason, many APIs and Web Services return data as JSON.
