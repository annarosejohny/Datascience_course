### Big data and Data mining

## Cloud computing
- Delivery of on-demand computing resources
  - networks
  - servers
  - storage
  - applications
  - services
  - data centers
- Applications and data that users access over the internet
  - online web apps
  - secure online business applications
  - storing personal files
    - google drive
    - one drive
    - dropbox
- User benefits of cloud computing
  - No need to purchase applications and install on local computers
  - Use online versions of applications and pay monthly subscriptions
  - More cost-effective
  - Access most current software versions
  - save local storage space
  - work collaboratively in real time
- Characteristics
  1. on-demand self-service
    - On-demand self-service means that you get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, using a simple interface, without requiring human interaction with each service provider
  2. Broad network access
    - Broad network access means that cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.
  3. Resource pooling
    - Resource pooling is what gives cloud providers economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient
    - Using a multitenant model, computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers, and cloud resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand, without customers needing to know the physical location of these resources.
  4. Rapid elasticity
    - Rapid elasticity implies that you can access more resources when you need them, and scale back when you don’t, because resources are elastically provisioned and released. 
  5. Measured service
    - measured service means that you only pay for what you use or reserve as you go.
    - If you’re not using resources, you’re not paying.
    - Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on consumer utilization.
- Cloud deployment models
  1. Public
    - Public cloud is when you leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies
  2. private
    - Private cloud means that the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization.
    - It could run on-premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.
  3. Hybrid
    - when you use a mix of both public and private clouds, working together seamlessly, that is classified as the hybrid cloud model.
- Cloud service models
  1. Infrastructure as a Service (or IaaS)
    -  In an IaaS model, you can access the infrastructure and physical computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space without the need to manage or operate them
  2. Platform as a Service (or PaaS)
    -  In a PaaS model, you can access the platform that comprises the hardware and software tools that are usually needed to develop and deploy applications to users over the Internet.
  3. Software as a Service (or SaaS)
     - SaaS is a software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis.
     - It is sometimes referred to as “on-demand software"

## Big data

Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines. It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value

- V's of big data
  1. Velocity
    - Velocity is the speed at which data accumulates.
    - Data is being generated extremely fast, in a process that never stops.
    - Near or real-time streaming, local, and cloud-based technologies can process information very quickly.
  2. Volume
    - Volume is the scale of the data, or the increase in the amount of data stored.
    - Drivers of volume are the increase in data sources, higher resolution sensors, and scalable infrastructure.
  3. Variety
    - Variety is the diversity of the data.
    - Structured data fits neatly into rows and columns, in relational databases while unstructured data is not organized in a pre-defined way, like Tweets, blog posts, pictures, numbers, and video.
    - Variety also reflects that data comes from different sources, machines, people, and processes, both internal and external to organizations.
    - Drivers are mobile technologies, social media, wearable technologies, geo technologies, video, and many, many more. 
  4. Veracity
    - Veracity is the quality and origin of data, and its conformity to facts and accuracy.
    - Attributes include consistency, completeness, integrity, and ambiguity.
    - Drivers include cost and the need for traceability.
    - With the large amount of data available, the debate rages on about the accuracy of data in the digital age. Is the information real, or is it false?
  5. Value
    - Value is our ability and need to turn data into value.
    - Value isn't just profit. It may have medical or social benefits, as well as customer, employee, or personal satisfaction.
    - The main reason that people invest time to understand Big Data is to derive value from it
